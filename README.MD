Project: "The Staywell" -- www.stayneartheark.com (domain to be hosted via AWS eventually).  NOTE -- www.thestaywell.com was not available.

Project Completed For:  Code Kentucky Web Development - Part 1 (Thursday Night Class) AND Myself!

Reason for Project:  This project served dual purposes for me:

    1.  This site was needed for an Airbnb ("The Staywell") I hope to run someday.

    2.  Home computers and The World Wide Web were fairly new when I was in young, and we were never taught any kind of computer sciences.  This became a real problem for me when I hired some web developers to work on a few web/tech projects that I am trying to complete.  Thankfully, I found Code Kentucky, and in just 12 short weeks, I am able to communicate with these developers and actually understand what they are talking about.  It has made a world of difference in being able to manage and guide them in developing my projects.   

Intent of Project:  To provide my own independent booking site for my Airbnb and keep more of the revenue for myself.

Code Kentucky Project Requirements:

    1.  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

            a.  "Created a Responsive Menu with Javascript"
            b.  "Stay Well at the Staywell" hero text includes a "Transition Animation Upon Arrival to the Site"
            c.  Button hover colors "Add Transition Animation Upon Hover"
    
    Hopefully the project is visually appealing.  Design is my weakness, so I have a lady in Brazil who helps me with them.  For this project, I had her create a logo and I used the colors in the logo throughout the site.  credit: Ivana Giseli - ivanadesign123@gmail.com

    2.  The project includes at least 2 Mobile-First Media Queries.

    3.  My project is uploaded to Gitbub (https://github.com/nikkimnik/hildrednbaker.git) and has at least 5 separate commits.  NOTE - While developing, I had extra "trial" files where I created multiple versions of the site, etc.  I was fearful that when I made my final file decisions and deleted these files to clean up my repository that it would take away from my number of commits.  I found out, however, that it did not.

    4.  This README.md file is included.

    5.  The Staywell is a fully formed website with Header, Body Sections, and Footer.

    6.  I did my best at being semantic!

    7.  Flexbox was used.

    8.  I did my best to make it accessible!
